SNMP Plugin for Graylog
=======================
Fork specific info:
[Download the plugin](https://github.com/illukas/graylog-plugin-snmp/releases)
and place the `.jar` file in your Graylog plugin directory. Restart Graylog.

Launch a new input and configure it:
   -Settings marked Optional are needed only for V3 inputs. Leave them at default for v1/v2c.
   -If you absolutely must use udp/162 port, then route traffic in your firewall udp/162 > udp/1620 because Graylog can't bind   to ports under 1024.
   -Additional MIBs are now sorted by filename 0-9/a-Z after loading, which happens after receiving the first trap. MIB loader writes what its doing into the graylog server log.
   -Traps that fail to match the configuration or security model will produce an error message in the graylog server log. V3 traps tend to fail without errors. That shall be looked into in the future.

This plugin provides an input plugin to receive SNMP traps.

**Required Graylog version:** 2.0.0 and later

## Caveat

This plugin is still pretty young and hasn't seen production traffic yet. Please [let us know](/issues) if you see any problems. Thank you!

## Installation

[Download the plugin](https://github.com/graylog-labs/graylog-plugin-snmp/releases)
and place the `.jar` file in your Graylog plugin directory. The plugin directory
is the `plugins/` folder relative from your `graylog-server` directory by default
and can be configured in your `graylog.conf` file.

Restart `graylog-server` and you are done.

## Setup

To get a basic set of MIB files on Linux you should install the `snmp` and `snmp-mibs-downloader` packages (the names might be different depending on the OS) and execute the `download-mibs` command. This fetches a lot of standard MIBs and installs them into the standard directories.

In the Graylog web interface, go to System/Inputs and create a new SNMP input like this:

![SNMP input creation dialog](images/snmp-input-1.png)

Now you can point your SNMP devices to the configured IP address and port to receive SNMP traps.


### Custom MIBs

The input creation dialog allows you to configure a path to custom MIB files. Alternatively you can also copy your custom MIB files into the `/usr/share/mibs` directory which is included by default.
Please keep in mind that some MIBs need to be loaded with a special order. To achieve this create numbered sub-directories in your MIB load path and place the files there in the right order.
E.g. VMWare MIBs have to be loaded in this order:

```
   VMWARE-ROOT-MIB.mib 
   VMWARE-TC-MIB.mib 
   VMWARE-PRODUCTS-MIB.mib 
   VMWARE-SYSTEM-MIB.mib
   VMWARE-ENV-MIB.mib
   VMWARE-RESOURCES-MIB.mib
   VMWARE-VMINFO-MIB.mib
   ...
```

So you should create a directory structure like:

```
   /usr/share/mibs/1/VMWARE-ROOT-MIB.mib 
   /usr/share/mibs/2/VMWARE-TC-MIB.mib 
   /usr/share/mibs/3/VMWARE-PRODUCTS-MIB.mib
    ...
```

## Limitations

Currently only the `public` SNMP community is supported by the plugin.

## Plugin Development

This project is using Maven 3 and requires Java 8 or higher.

* Clone this repository.
* Download [Mibble](http://www.mibble.org/download/index.html)
* `mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=net.percederberg -DartifactId=mibble-parser -Dversion=2.9.3 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=mibble-2.9.3/lib/mibble-parser-2.9.3.jar` (replace mibble version with the one you downloaded)
* `mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=net.percederberg -DartifactId=mibble-mibs -Dversion=2.9.3 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=mibble-2.9.3/lib/mibble-mibs-2.9.3.jar` (replace mibble version with the one you downloaded)
* Run `mvn package` to build a JAR file.
* Optional: Run `mvn jdeb:jdeb` and `mvn rpm:rpm` to create a DEB and RPM package respectively.
* Copy generated JAR file in target directory to your Graylog plugin directory.
* Install system packages 'snmp' and 'snmp-mibs-downloader'
* Execute 'sudo download-mibs'
* Copy additional MIB files to `/usr/share/mibs`
* Restart the Graylog.
* Send test trap `sudo snmptrap -v 2c -c public 127.0.0.1:1620 '' .1.3.6.1.4.1.5089.1.0.1 .1.3.6.1.4.1.5089.2.0.999 s "123456"`

## Plugin Release

We are using the maven release plugin:

```
$ mvn release:prepare
[...]
$ mvn release:perform
```

This sets the version numbers, creates a tag and pushes to GitHub. Travis CI will build the release artifacts and upload to GitHub automatically.
